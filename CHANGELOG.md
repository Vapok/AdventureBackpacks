* Note From Author:

_I am incredibly sorry for the length of time it has taken for me to fix this issue.  Since Thanksgiving of 2023, I've been going through some deep family and personal issues, where mental health, depression, and family took over my life. Christmas was especially hard this year. Thank you for your understanding. I am coming out of it and starting to gain control back over my interactions with myself and the world._

   * The original two prefabs, have been identified as legacy items, that can no longer be built.  They will live on in your inventory as "Old".  Functionally, they'll exist as they have been.  But they aren't craftable, nor are they upgradeable.  (though they are configurable).
   * The 6 new Prefabs, introduce the 6 new bags that are intended to be used as progression bags.
   * The mod author would prefer that folks adventure in the world of Valheim and stumble across what it takes to craft the assortment of bags, however, those with less adventuring desires, may look at the configuration, where I do expose all of the recipes and what you have to touch in order to gain the recipes.  Yes, this also means that all of the bags are configurable for those that pack to the beat of a different drum.
   * The 6 new backpacks are:
     * **Satchel** - _A small backpack capable of holding things._
     * **Rugged Backpack**  - _A rugged backpack, complete with buckles and fine leather straps._
     * **Bloodbag Wetpack** - _A durable backpack sealed using waterproof blood bags._
     * **Arctic Sherpa Pack** - _An arctic backpack, fit for long treks through the mountains._
     * **Lox Hide Knappsack** - _An adventuring backpack made from extremely durable lox hide._
     * **Explorers Wisppack** - _A finely crafted, mystical backpack. Complete with it's own Box of Holding. No one is quite sure how it works._
   * Greatly Expanded and 100% completely configurable settings.
